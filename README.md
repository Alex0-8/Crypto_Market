This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Data Fetching & Caching: TanStack Query (@tanstack/react-query)
- Charts: Recharts
- Animations: Framer Motion

# Architecture and Folder Structure
I chose this structure to improve reusability and scalability.

# Use of AI in Development
I actively used Grok throughout the project:

- Brainstorming layout ideas and architectural decisions
- Initial generation of TypeScript interfaces and custom hooks
- Code suggestions for components, as this is my first time using Next.js

I always reviewed and adapted the generated code to ensure quality and correct typing.
